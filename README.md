The programmes are designed to automatically co-register the satellite elevation data sets (e.g. DEM, laser altimetry data sets, GPS).

coregister_dem2dem.py could coregister DEM B (DEM desired to be coregistered) to DEM A (the master DEM).

coregister_dem2point.py could coregister DEM (DEM desired to be coregistered) to altimetry points (e.g. LiDAR, ICESat, GPS).

The programmes would call arcpy, numpy, scipy or matplotlib.
